                During projects and presentations in school I've always focused on entertaining people in a way where they also get the academic knowledge.
                It would be through fun editing using Imovie and interviews of people. A simple presentation was never an option; the user-experience was the focus.
                Everything in tech is becoming more and more human-centered where user-experience is important. The product that we make has to resonate 
                deeply with an audience or else there isn't any point. As a software engineer it's an important asset to have in mind. UI/UX-experience has caught my interest and I enjoy working with it. One of my main focus anf challenges
                is the ethical design when developing an application which I want to work with more. 
          


                <!--As a software engineer student I have been focusing on making clean code, but not really focused on the user experience. 
                But it resonated with me that User Experience Design is as important as writing good code. If 
                the product we make doesnt resonate deeply with an audience then what is the point? 
                Everything in tech is becoming more and more human-centered and we as software engineers need to have that in mind. 
                I want to walk/work hand in hand with software development, UX-design and Web-design. Furthermore 
                I want to focus on ethical design, because it's important to have that in mind while designing. The question is 
                are we following the business model or the ethical design model?
                -->

                <!--
                Everything is becoming more and more human-centered. As a software engineer 
                student I have learned that it is important to think about the human. 
                

                human centered design resonate deeply with an audience.
                as mentioned in the new viral documentary "Social Dilemma" human centered design 
                has a huge impact in the world already. Furthermore we need to as designers
                to look at UI and UX with an ethical view. 
                Software Engineer with a huge interest in front end development.
                business model or follow ethical design
                You will get 
                an insight of my work and my journey.

                That making a product that is human centered is the future. I want tobe able to make human centered design that 
                resonate deeply with an audience with the aspect of ethical design.-->
