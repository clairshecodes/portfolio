                I am a software engineering student and a music enthusiast. It was my time in the studio that made my decision to become a software engineer easy.
                The process of building a song takes building blocks like piano, guitar, a bass and the right vocals. These 
                are all based on the right chords. The wrong chords make the song sound awful. If one draws parallels to sofware technology, you 
                build code that has different functionalities that need to work together to complete the program.
                The fact that I can sit with projects and see an end result is so fascinating and I do that in the studio and in programming.
                I get the opportunity to experiment with my creativity in school and see it shine through physical aspects.
                During my time at university so far I've gotten the opportunity to be more creative through UI and UX design. This has 
                become one of my main hobbies which I explore daily. With some knowledge within back-end and front-end development I believe it's 
                a great combination of knowledge to have and I want to use this to my advantage in the future.



                <!--You build and build code and code has different parts that at the end completes a program, 
                every single part has a huge part in the program working. Its the same with producing music,
                you have to play the correct chords between the instruments for the song to work, furthermore
                the voice has to be at the right place aswell. This made me choose software technology.
                Throughout university i've gotten closer and closer to what I see myself doing for the rest of my life.
                And that is that I want to focuse on UX-Experience and web-and application design. I am very creative 
                and I find it very interesting. Furthermore I also still want to do some backend coding.
                I belive it's good to have front-end and back-end skills cause then you can also be communication between that.
