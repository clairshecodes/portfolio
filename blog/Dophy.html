            <br/>
 
         
            
              Stress in children is an increasingly growing problem. 
              A child's life can be quite stressful due to various factors, including test anxiety, problems with friends, 
              bullying, body changes and family issues. A review of 22 relevant studies found strong
              indecations that pet ownership may be beneficial to child and adolescent emotional, cognitive, 
              behavioural, educational and social development. Dogs seem to be the most beneficial and studied of all. 
              Dophy, the talking dog robot, was developed with these in mind. 
         
          <br>
        </br>
            <h1 class="font-bold">Scope</h1>
            <p>
              Even before the advancements in modern technology, we had a robotic dog without
              any artificial intellegence as a children toy. 
              They were simply used to entertain kids, but with help from the advancements in modern technology these
              simple dogs can even replace our dog friends and be used as therapy dogs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="font-bold">Solution</h1>
            <p>Our Solution consists of two main components
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside ">
                <li>Physical part of the robot dog</li>
                <li>Artificial intelligence of the dog</li>
              </ul>  
            The robotic dog will help child to reduce anxiety and stress by scanning the face
            of the child and listening to child's problems.
            Then it will execute some actions according to emotional state of the child. Physical side 
            of the dog should be cuddly and fluffy so that whenever the child touches the dog, the child will feel 
            comfort. 
            Artificial intelligence side of the dog should be used to evaluate child's emotional state
            and also should be able to execute some certain actions such as
            singing a song, telling a story. 
            In order to receive and understand the command of the child, technologies such as voice recognition,
            voice intonation could be used. Also, for face scanning, image analysis can be utilised.
            
            </p>


            <h1 class="font-bold">The Iterative Process</h1>
              <h3 class="font-semibold"> First iterations </h3>
              <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> We defined our problem as: 
              Phychologists having a hard time when trying to therapize the children with social disorders. 
              It was a problem because children with social disorders might not want to talk about their 
              problems to another grown-up. 
              We aimed to monitor children with the help of robotic dog during their treatment process, and 
              children would be monitored through this dog from psychologist.
              <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
                In order to validate our idea, we have used feed-backs we got from workshop session. 
                We have applied qualitative a-b-testing to our applicants with various questions. In 
                addtion to that, we gave applicants a list of interface elements (icons) and asked them 
                to build an interface using icons. Then, since applicants familiarized with our system, 
                we asked them to verbalize their opinions (Thinking-out-loud).

                <h1 class="text-center">A/B test</h1>
                <br>
             <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1>
             Regarding our monioring therapy dog idea, the users think it is creepy to be monitored by 
             a psychologist through a robotic dog. Even though dog was aimed to be interacting with children, 
             our costumer segment would be parents of the children. Therefore, we had to scrape the idea 
             of monitoring dog. Instead, we decided to have a toy-like dog just as a fiend to children and landing page changed accordingly.

             <br>

             <h3 class="font-semibold"> Second iterations </h3>
             <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1>  A changed problem and solution should be validated. 
             Since we have changed our robot-dog as a toy and dog will interact with children as a friend, 
             we have to find out what kind of interactions we would like to have between such dog and child.
             <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
             In order to validate our robot-dog friend idea, we conduct a survey on kids and their parents. 
             In this survey, we directed both quantitative and qualitative a-b questions to them(Which kind of dog preferable for kids? 
             Fluffy, real looking or robotic looking? etc.).
             In addition to this survey, we also reached out to dog-owners from our acquaintances, 
             and directed them some questions(interview-like) about what kind of interactions they have with their real dogs.
             <div class="fakeimg transform rotateimg180 translate-y-0 scale-75" ><img src="/images/Blog-img/Dophy/q1-Dophy.PNG" ></div>
             <h1 class="text-center">Survey</h1>
             <br>
             <div class="fakeimg transform rotateimg180 translate-y-0 scale-75" ><img src="/images/Blog-img/Dophy/q2-Dophy.PNG" ></div>
             <h1 class="text-center">Survey</h1>
             <br>
            <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
            Regarding kids' preferences about dog appearance, most of them stated that they would like to have fluffy, real looking dog.
             Also, children described the idea of speaking dogs as funny and cute. As a result of interviews with dog-owners, we have found out 4 most common interactions. 
             Cuddling, snuggling, talking with dog and petting the dog are the main interactions that is between dog and owner.

            <h3 class="font-semibold"> Third iteration </h3>
            <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> 
            In this iteration, we have to validate our customer segment and need to validate market to make sure that our product is perceived as usable by users. 
            Our customer segment is suspicious because we decided to aim all children and it seems way too large segment.
            <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
            In order to validate our customer segment, we have made discussions with Per and TA and tried to maximize their feedback as much as possible by directing some questions(Likes, Questions, Criticisms, Ideas). 
            For validating our market, we have made online research and find out similar type of projects. 
            In addition to similar type of projects, we also made some research on psychological aspects of the robotic-dogs.
           <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
           After this iteration, we returned back to kind of therapy dog idea as a result of professor's and TA's feedback with research results. 
           Professor and TA said that our customer segment too broad. We narrowed it down to kids with social disorders but not as a whole treatment just to help them out a little bit(reducing anxiety and relieving stress).
            Hence, target group has changed from all children to children with anxiety. 
            For market validation, we have found plenty of papers and articles that is similar to our project
            Also, we have found some studies that is showing robotic-pet's can be used to reduce stress and anxiety for children. 
            Therefore, market has been validated by the help of these aforementioned papers.
           <br>
           <h3 class="font-semibold"> Last iteration </h3>
           <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> In this iteration, we need to validate that our prototype is a Minimum Viable Product(MVP).
            We have to decide about what functionalities are most essential ones, and check if they are matching perfectly with our solution defined in Lean Canvas. 
            Also, we have to check if our functionalities in MVP matches with our User Story Map(USM).
          
           <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
           In order to validate if our prototype is indeed MVP, we have made discussion with Per(professor) and we tried simulate user behavior(cognitive walk-through).
            We explained to the proffesor how our robo-dog works and how it interacts with people(children), and made him verbalize his opinion on last version of our robo-dog prototype(thinking-out loud). 
            We also used wizard of oz technique in this iteration, because we have tried to mimic our prototype with a bear doll and make it speak by using our voice.
          <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
          According to feedback we got from professor and our user simulations, MVP should not need to be a walking dog. 
          We have eliminated walking functionality of our prototype. 
          MVP has been minimized to must functionalities which are scanning face, understanding the mood, and executing certain tasks such as telling a story, singing a song cuddling etc.
