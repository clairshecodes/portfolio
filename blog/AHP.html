                Chronic illnesses affect all dimensions of human life and can take it's toll on a person's emotional well-being. 
                Being a child and hospitilized places additional burden to the child's psychology. However, children's vivid imagination allows
                for their minds to be easily distracted from issues with simple activities such as playing games. Our work is based on existing work
                based on guided imagery, combined with different aspects of play. In this way to help children overcome the emotional effects of 
                chronic illness.

            <h1 class="font-bold">Scope</h1>
            <p>
              Initially, our problem is defined to help children who are having a hard time during their cancer treatment process.
              These children are having a hard time getting away from their daily life at hospital, as a result of that they are being depressed.
              Since morale plays an important role in the treatment process, keeping the children happy is the essence. Throughout iterations, we 
              have come to realization that our problem includes all hospitalized children. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="font-bold">Solution</h1>
            <p>Our Solution consists of three main components
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside ">
                <li>VR glasses</li>
                <li>App</li>
                <li>Remote for the VR glasses</li>
              </ul> 
              With the help of VR glasses, the child will be able to enter and customize their own world using imagination.
              After creating the world, the child will be able to spend time inside the world and wander around in their Happy 
              Place in order to move away from troubles they are facing during their time in the hospital. 
              The remote is being used to draw new object in the virtual world. The chold will be able to draw desired objects in 2D and it will be 
              translated into 3D by using image analysis and image processing, along with machine learning techniques to match drawings with real objects.
              Similar technologies have already been implemented in the <p class="italic">Gravity Sketch 3D drawing pad and Google's experiment AutoDraw</p>
              <br>
              <h1 class="font-bold">The Iterative Process</h1>
              <h3 class="font-semibold"> First iterations </h3>
              <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> We defined our problem as following:   
                Kids who undergoes cancer treatment are having a hard time getting away from their troubles. 
              We aimed to solve the problem by providing them a dreamland they created. 
              <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
                In order to validate our idea, we have used feed-backs we got from poster presentations (Landing Page) and from discussions. We made some
                litterature research about our idea so that we are sure that our idea could potentially work and the assumptions we're building on are suggested by litterature. 
             <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1>
             Regarding our problem and solution, people think it was indeed a real problem and should be a way to go for us. But our market
             segment challenged the TA. He asked us about why we only aimed to help children with cancer and not all hospitilized children.
             As a result, we realized that our target is all kids who are hospitilized ong duration and feel lonely. Therefor we changed our customer segment to 
             "Children who are hospitilized long duration because of an ilness and feels lonely".

             <br>

             <h3 class="font-semibold"> Second iterations </h3>
             <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> We want to validate our interfaces that user is going to interact. 
             We have to decide what kind of devices should be used whenever child is drawing objects, creating it's own world etc. So, 
             user preferences should be identified for our system.
             <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
               In order to find out user's preferences, we conducted a survey on students. In this survey, we directed qualititative a-b questions
               to them for the drawing tool. Options such as remote controller, pen with tablet and pen with Apple Magic Trackpad. In addition 
               we have also reached out to kids from our acquantances, and directed them some questions about the kind of interactions they prefere in our system.
          
            <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
            Regarding user's preferences about drawing tool, majority decided to go with Oculus VR Headset (Drawing with remotes). 
            In harmony with survey results, children find the idea of drawing objects with remotes more entertaining that other options provided.
            <div class="fakeimg" ><img src="/images/Blog-img/AHP-System.PNG" ></div>
            <h1 class="text-center">A/B test</h1>
            <br>
            <h3 class="font-semibold"> Third iteration </h3>
            <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> Regarding the survey there were questions asked such as if the VR headsets potentially making the 
            child feel worse during treatment because chemo has a tendency to make people nauseous. Therefor, we have to find out if it's the case or not. 
            In addition to these questions, an idea for detecting child's emotional state by our system and providing it as feedback to doctors should be further investigated.
            <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
              In order to resolve if VR sets are suittable for children under cancer treatment, we have made some online research. 
              For pitching our idea to detect child's emotions, we have conducted an interview with a doctor. 
         
           <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
              According to our online research, we found out that virtual reality goggles help ease the pain of cancer treatment for kids.
              Therefor, we concluded our solution to be applicable to them. 
              For the emotional detections the doctor stated that ECG and heart pulse detections is not enough to give feedback of emotional response.
              Instead, we should check brain's activity, so some receptors e.g. adrenaline and serotonin, and maybe their general situation and psychological
              state, if they are happy, they smile laugh. As an outcome we realized that using facial recognition or eye-tracking would be a better option 
              for our cause.

           <br>
           <br>
           <h3 class="font-semibold"> Last iteration </h3>
           <h1 class="font-semibold"> What: </h1> In the last iteration, we have to validate that our prototype is indeed a real MVP (Minimun viable product) and fit's user 
           requirements perfectly. We have to decide which functionalities are most essential ones, and check if they serve our solution as intended. 
           Especially, emotional feedback to doctor from child should be investigated further. 
          
           <h1 class="font-semibold">How:</h1>
             In order to validate if our prototype is indeed MVP, we have discussed with our professor and we tried to simulate user behavior (cognitive walk-through).
             We explained to our Professor how our emotional recognition works, and made him verbalize his opinion on last version of out prototype (Thinking-out-loud). 
             We also used feed-backs from Friday presentation to check if people see any unnecessary aspects in our MVP.
          <h1 class="font-semibold">Outcome:</h1> 
              We had to change emotion detection method because eye-tracking and facial detection was ambiguous to the users. 
              System has changed to detect child's emotion by making use of decisions child made to customize the virtual world such
              as, what kind of landscape, happy place child choose or what kind of objects child used in virtual world. 
              Another emotion detection system we have decided to add is "self-reporting". Children will be asked regarding their emotions 
              after the VR session. Direct output will be received regarding the feelings of children by the doctors.
